# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)
Implemented concurrency using forks and it processes downloads in parallel
first. After that it will process uploads in parallel.

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)
Filenames longer than FILENAMESIZ-1 overrun the buffer. 
Fixed by changing strcpy(t->filename, filename) to strcpy(t->filename, filename, FILENAMESIZ)


# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)
The peer should not serve files located in any other directory.
Fixed by checking that the character '/' is not in t->filename: memchr(t->filename, '/', FILENAMESIZ) != 0

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

# Extra credit problems
#Extra credit problem: none

# Add any other information you'd like us to know below this line.
