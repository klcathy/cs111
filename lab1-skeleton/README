Lab 1C:

There are no known limitations based on the testcases we created.

Lab 1B:

There is a problem when we have simulatenous input/output redirection for
subshell commands.

Lab 1A:

There are currently no known limitations based on the test cases.

Our implementation of 1a can be divided into three main parts: 
reading, tokenizing, parsing.
For reading, we conducted syntax validation and separated command 
trees by newlines and stored it in the buffer.
For tokenizing, we used the fact that command trees were separated by
newlines to tokenize them into token streams. The token streams had
a pointer to the next token streams, so it was like a singly-linked 
list. 
We then parsed the token streams into the proper command tree and
returned the root of it to be stored in an array located in the 
command stream.
