CS111: Operating System Principles
=====

This is a repository for the projects assigned in Professor Eggert's Spring 2014
class. The README.txt contained in each project was for submission purposes.

### Lab 1: Time Travel Shell
----------------------------------------

We built a UNIX shell that analyzes the dependencies of commands in a shell script
and runs top-level commands in parallel. We also implemented the design project
for part A, which recognizes the redirection operators.

### Lab 2: Ramdisk
----------------------------------------

We wrote a Linux kernel module that implements a ramdisk that supports read/write
operations and a special read/write locking mechanism to allow a process to gain
exclusive access to the ramdisk.

### Lab 3: File System Driver
----------------------------------------

We implemented a file system driver for Linux that supports reading files/directories,
changing file sizes, writing/creating files, creating hard/symbolic links, and support
for conditional links.

### Lab 4: OSP2P Protocol
----------------------------------------

Given a fully functional OSP2P peer client, we had to modify the code to support
multiple downloads in parallel and multiple uploads in parallel. Furthermore, we
had to improve the peer's robustness to attacks and implement at least two ways
to attack the client.
